Before diving into the inner mechanisms of [Riverpod], let's start with the basics:
Installing up [Riverpod], and then writing a "Hello world".

## What package to install

Before anything, you need to be aware that [Riverpod] is spread across multiple packages, with slightly different usage.  
As such, the variant of [Riverpod] that you will want to install depends on the app you are making.

You can refer to the following table to help you decide which package to use:

| app type                  | package name                                                                       | description                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flutter + [flutter_hooks] | [hooks_riverpod]                                                                   | An improved syntax with less boilerplate for listening providers inside widgets.                                                               |
| Flutter only              | [flutter_riverpod]                                                                 | A slightly more verbose syntax (comparable to `Theme.of` vs `StreamBuilder`). But feature-wise, it is otherwise identical to [hooks_riverpod]. |
| Dart only (No Flutter)    | [riverpod](https://github.com/rrousselGit/river_pod/tree/master/packages/riverpod) | A version of [Riverpod] striped out of all the classes related to Flutter                                                                      |

And if not clear enough, you can refer to this decision graph:

## Installing the package

Once you know what package you want to install, proceed to add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

<Tabs
  groupId="riverpod"
  defaultValue="hooks_riverpod"
  values={[
    { label: 'Flutter + flutter_hooks', value: 'hooks_riverpod', },
    { label: 'Flutter', value: 'flutter_riverpod', },
    { label: 'Dart only', value: 'riverpod', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="hooks_riverpod">

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.7.0 <3.0.0"
  flutter: ">= 1.17.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_hooks: ^0.9.0
  hooks_riverpod: ^0.0.1
```

Then run `flutter pub get`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="flutter_riverpod">

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.7.0 <3.0.0"
  flutter: ">= 1.17.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_riverpod: ^0.0.1
```

Then run `flutter pub get`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="riverpod">

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.7.0 <3.0.0"

dependencies:
  riverpod: ^0.0.1
```

Then run `pub get`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's it. You've added [Riverpod] to your app!

## Usage example: Hello world

Now that we have installed [Riverpod], we can start using it.

The following snippets showcase our to use our new dependency to make a "Hello world":

<Tabs
  groupId="riverpod"
  defaultValue="hooks_riverpod"
  values={[
    { label: "Flutter + flutter_hooks", value: "hooks_riverpod" },
    { label: "Flutter", value: "flutter_riverpod" },
    { label: "Dart only", value: "riverpod" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="hooks_riverpod">

```dart
// lib/main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

// We create a "provider", which will store a value (here "Hello world").
// By using a provider, this allows us to mock/override the value exposed.
final helloWorldProvider = Provider((_) => 'Hello world');

void main() {
  runApp(
    // For widgets to be able to read providers, we need to wrap the entire
    // application in a "ProviderScope" widget.
    // This is where the state of our providers will be stored.
    ProviderScope(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

// Note: MyApp is a HookWidget, from flutter_hooks.
class MyApp extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // To read our provider, we can use the hook "useProvider".
    // This is only possible because MyApp is a HookWidget.
    final String value = useProvider(helloWorldProvider);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(value),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Which you can then execute with `flutter run`.  
This will render "Hello world" in on your device.

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Example')),
        body: Center(
          // The widget "Consumer" is a widget that takes a provider,
          // read its value, and pass it to its "builder" parameter.
          // Here it is written as Consumer<String>, because the provider
          // that we are reading stores a String.
          child: Consumer<String>(
            helloWorldProvider,
            builder: (BuildContext context, String value, Widget child) {
              return Text(value);
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Which you can then execute with `flutter run`.  
This will render "Hello world" in on your device.

final helloWorldProvider = Provider((_) => 'Hello world');

void main() {
  // This object is where the state of our providers will be stored.
  final owner = ProviderStateOwner();

  // Thanks to "owner", we can read our provider.
  final value = helloWorldProvider.readOwner(owner);

  print(value); // Hello world
}
```

Which you can then execute with `dart lib/main.dart`.  
This will print "Hello world" in the console.
