Now that we have installed [Riverpod], let's talk about "providers".

## What is a provider

Providers are the most important part of a [Riverpod] application.

A provider is an object that encapsulate a piece of state and allow listening
to that state.
By wrapping a piece of state in a provider, this:

- Allows easily accessing that state in multiple locations.  
  Providers are a complete replacement for patterns like Singletons,
  Service Locators, Dependency Injection or InheritedWidgets.

- Simplifies combining this state with others.  
  Ever struggled merging multiple objects into one? This scenario is built
  directly inside providers, with a simple syntax.

- Enables performance optimisations.  
  Whether for filtering widget rebuilds or for caching expensive state computations;
  providers ensure that only what is impacted by a state change is recomputed.

- Increases the testability of your application.  
  With providers, you do not need complex `setUp`/`tearDown` steps. Futhermore,
  any provider can be overriden to behave differently during test, which
  allows easily testing a very specific behavior.

- Easily integrate with advanced features, such as logging or pull-to-refresh.

## Creating a provider

Providers come in many variants, but they all work the same way.

The most common usage is to declare them as global constant like so:

```dart
final myProvider = Provider((ref) {
  return MyValue();
});
```

:::note
Do not be afraid by the global aspect of providers.  
Providers are fully immutable. Declaring a provider is no different from declaring
a function, and is testable and maintainable.
:::

This snippet consist of three components:

- `final myProvider`, the declaration of a variable.  
  This variable is what we will use in the future to read the state of our provider.
  It should always be immutable.

- `Provider`, the provider that we decided to use.  
  [Provider] is the most basic of all providers. It exposes an object that never
  changes.  
  We could replace [Provider] with other providers like [StreamProvider] or
  [StateNotifierProvider], to change how the value is interacted with.

- A function that creates the shared state.  
  That function will always receive an object called `ref` as a parameter. This object
  allows us to read other providers or to perform some operations when the state
  of our provider will be destroyed.

The type of the object created by the function passed to a provider depends on
the provider used.  
For example, the function of a [Provider] can create any object.
On the other hand, [StreamProvider]'s callback will be expected to return a [Stream].

:::info
You can declare as many providers as you, want without limitations.  
As opposed to when using `package:provider`, in [Riverpod] we can have two
providers expose a state of the same "type":

```dart
final cityProvider = Provider((ref) => 'London');
final countryProvider = Provider((ref) => 'England');
```

The fact that both providers create a `String` does not cause any problem.
:::

:::caution
For providers to work, you must add [ProviderScope] at the root of your
Flutter applications:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));
}
```
