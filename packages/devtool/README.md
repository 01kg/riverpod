# Black Lives Matter. [Support the Equal Justice Initiative.](https://support.eji.org/give/153413/#!/donation/checkout)

Welcome to `devtool`.

This repository is a companion to the [Riverpod] suite.\
It adds a work-in-progress devtool to inspect and edit the state of your application.

It has the following focuses:

- State inspection.\
  It allows to read all the properties of an object in a readable way.

  This is possible by either having an object implement [Diagnosticable] or
  if the object is generated by [Freezed] (>= 0.11.0-dev)

- Allow editing the state from the user-interface.\
  At the moment, this is only supported for [Freezed] objects.

- Time-traveling.\
  It allows seeing the history of the changes made in the application and
  to undo a change if the state supports edition.

  Time-traveling works for every objects, but the "undo" operation currently
  supports only [Freezed] objects.

It is not in a usable state, but contributions are welcomed!

## Start the devtool

To start the devtool, open the `example` folder and run `flutter run`.
